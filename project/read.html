      <h2>Literature Survey</h2>
      <p>Hydropower has been used since ancient times to grind flour and perform other tasks. In the late 18th century hydraulic power provided the energy source needed for the start of the Industrial Revolution. In the mid-1770s, French engineer Bernard Forest de Bélidor published Architecture Hydraulique, which described vertical- and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines, and in 1771 Richard Arkwright’s combination of water power, the water frame, and continuous production played a significant part in the development of the factory system, with modern employment practices. In 1878, the world's first hydroelectric power scheme was developed at Cragside in Northumberland, England by William Armstrong. It was used to power a single arc lamp in his art gallery. Hoover Dam's initial 1,345 MW power station was the world's largest hydroelectric power station in 1936; it was eclipsed by the 6,809 MW Grand Coulee Dam in 1942.The Itaipu Dam opened in 1984 in South America as the largest, producing 14 GW, but was surpassed in 2008 by the Three Gorges Dam in China at 22.5 GW. Hydroelectricity would eventually supply some countries, including Norway, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Paraguay and Brazil, with over 85% of their electricity.</p>

      <h3>Problem Definition</h3>
      <p>While offering ecological advantages from a global perspective, such as climate change mitigation, emergency management, and reduction of flooding risk, the operation and construction of hydroelectric power plants may cause some environmental impacts on the local and regional level. These include harm to fish populations, a loss of aquatic habitat, a significant change in natural flow regimes, and deterioration of the landscape. The article aims to suggest various ways to resolve these issues, and to research the problems of 24 hydroelectric power plants operated and constructed on dams, rivers, and canals by the State Hydraulic Works (DSI) or private sector in the Buyuk Menderes Basin and in the West Mediterranean Basins in Turkey.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm">
      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <p>First, to turn kinetic energy of flowing water to electric power.

Second, to regulate the flow of the river, introducing dams and lakes to absorb the eventual exceeding volume of water due to massive/unexpected rainfall.

 It also may regulate consumption if coupled with far more unsteady wind generators…</p>
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <p>The infrastructure (basic building facilities and installations) required to develop hydroelectric energy is a dam, a hydroelectric power plant at the dam site to make power and the electrical grid for power distribution.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm">
      <h3>Output</h3>
      <p>The power output of a hydroelectric power plant is measured in kilowatts (1,000 watts) or megawatts (1,000,000 watts). Hydroelectric power plants are generally located at places on rivers or streams that can be easily dammed to create a reservoir of water. later the electricity is used for domestic purpose</p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Hydropower plants are a vital energy source to the world. Water is an efficient and reliable fuel. The use, creation, and expansion of power plants should continue being pursued.
